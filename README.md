# An Awesome Website

We will start this awesome day by some coding and your today's task will be to recreate a layout from a web page:

Here is the desired layout:

* [desktop](https://github.com/AndreaDvorakova/CodingBootcamp_Morning_Workout_Awsome_Website/blob/main/src/img/wide.png)
* [mobile](https://github.com/AndreaDvorakova/CodingBootcamp_Morning_Workout_Awsome_Website/blob/main/src/img/narrow%20(1).png)

## Build the page

Recreate this layout by using Flexbox and media queries. Also, use BEM for naming the classes and structure your CSS or SCSS files.

### Step 0 - OPTIONAL: Set up your development infrastructure to use Gulp
Whether or not you decide to use Gulp and subsequently SCSS over CSS is up to you.

### Step 1: Recreate the basic responsive layout
Recreate the basics of desired layout:

* the page needs to have the header section
* the page needs to have the section containing the content
* the content needs to be three "cards"
* the cards should contain a part dedicated to a picture and a paragraph of Lorem ipsum

### Step 2: Make it responsive
Make the design responsive

### Step 3 - OPTIONAL: Touch of Awesome
Add some finishing touches to get as close to the provided design as you can make it. Here are some ideas:

* use the Open Sans font from the Google fonts.
* for the icon you can download some image, use Font Awesome, etc, it is up to you.
